RWM – R Window Manager

RWM is a QT Desktop Environment / Window Wanager.
– The main goal is to develop an interface really simple, fast and beautiful. 
– Follow the K.I.S.S principle;
– Configurations are stored in $home/user/.rwm/ in xml files (simple and human readable);
– It should depend only on Qt libs;
– Default style is Oxygen, but others can be selected from qtconfig.
It is based on Antico (you can find the original here: http://www.antico.netsons.org/index.html).

DEVELOPMENT
************
To test the window manager, type on shell:

DISPLAY=:0
Xephyr :1 -ac -screen 800x600 & DISPLAY=:1; $HOME/windowManager/rwm-project/rwm
If there is some problem with your keyboard layout, just use the line above:
Xephyr :1 -ac -screen 800x600 -keybd ephyr,,xkbrules=evdev,xkblayout=br,xkbmodel=abnt2 & DISPLAY=:1; $HOME/windowManager/rwm-project/rwm


(where 800x600 is your preferred screen size and $HOME if you have download Antico in user home)
---------------------------------------------------
To hide debug messages, uncomment in antico.pro
//DEFINES = QT_NO_DEBUG_OUTPUT
---------------------------------------------------
***********
LANGUAGE
***********
Add your language in "antico.pro";
Type on shell "lupdate antico.pro";
Run "linguistic" and make your language translation;
Type on shell "lrelease antico.pro".
Your language.qm (e.g. it_IT.qm) should be in /language dir.

Use "qtconfig" to select your preferred style (Oxygen, Plastique), fonts, effects, etc.

Cause there isn't a respected standard in distro world :-(, the .desktop file is searched in /usr/share and the Trash in $HOME/.local/share
